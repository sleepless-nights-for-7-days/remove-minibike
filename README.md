# Effectively Remove the Minibike from 7 Days to Die
Hate the Minibike? Now you don't have to see it anymore.

## Changes
1. prevent Minibike, its Handlebars, or its Chassis from appearing in loot or trader inventory
1. prevent Minibike Handlebars and Chassis Schemaitcs from appearing in loot or trader inventory
1. remove Minibike Handlebars and Chassis as a learnable recipe from the Grease Monkey skill
    - adjust the English description for `Grease Monkey Rank 2` to reflect changes

## Notes
- Admins can still spawn, use, and/or give Minibikes to players
- Did not update non-English descriptions for `Grease Monkey Rank 2` since I don't have a high level of confidence in my understanding of other languages and didn't want to butcher them
